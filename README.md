# WIDS-2025-types-of-trees
All resources related to this WIDS will be uploaded here. For each week, we will provide resources for theory and pseudocdoes for standard algorithms. We will also recommned some problems for you to try for mostly all weeks so you can feel confident about using these data structures. The following is a rough week by week plan for this project, subject to change. 
### Week 1 : Implementing and using general trees. 
### Week 2 : Binary search trees, Heaps and B-trees 
#### Problems  : 
#### 1.LC 94
#### 2.LC 101
#### 3.LC 108
#### 4.LC 110
#### 5.LC 144
#### 6.LC 145
#### 7.LC 501
#### 8.LC 530
#### 9.LC 700
#### 10.LC 783
#### 11.LC 98
#### 12.LC 102 (medium,hint: does this look like some traversal you already know?)
#### 13.LC 235 (pretty tough to get the right and efficient idea. Try out examples on paper to get some hints)
#### 14.LC 1569 (A bonus and a very hard problem, that we expect anybody to do based on week1 + week2 knowledge)
### Week 3 : RB trees and AVL trees
### Week 4 : Tries and suffix tries 
### Week 5 : Fenwick Trees and Segment trees (Some basic applications only) 
### Week 6 : Treaps (We doubt we will able to cover this due to the time constraint we have, but we will try our best).
